# Tab Gallery — Visual Tab Manager for Chrome (Side Panel)

I built **Tab Gallery** to be a fast, Chrome-native **visual tab manager** looking with Google Material 3 design language built for power users who regularly work with dozens (or hundreds) of tabs.

Instead of opening a separate “tab manager” page, Tab Gallery lives directly in **Chrome’s Side Panel** — so you can organize, search, group, and clean up tabs without breaking your flow.

## Why Tab Gallery?

Chrome’s default tab strip becomes painful once you hit 30–100 tabs.

Tab Gallery solves this by giving you:
- a **visual overview** of all tabs (across all windows)
- **instant search**
- **native Chrome tab groups** management
- **smart grouping**
- **duplicate cleanup**
- **keyboard-first navigation**

All with a **Chrome-native UI** inside the Side Panel.

## Permissions (Why they are needed)

Chrome extensions require explicit permissions. Tab Gallery requests only what it needs:

- **`tabs`** → to display and manage your open tabs
- **`tabGroups`** → to create/edit Chrome tab groups
- **`sidePanel`** → to display UI inside Chrome Side Panel

> Note: Tab Gallery does not transmit any tab data anywhere. Everything runs locally.
